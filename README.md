# Clustering of White Wine Quality

## Title: Comparative Study of Prediction on White Wine Quality by Classification Techniques

The objectives of this case study:
1. To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the best performance
2. To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine.

Unsupervised Marching Learning Model:
1. [K-Nearest Neighbour](https://github.com/yiliang0303/Clustering-of-White-Wine-Quality/blob/main/K-Nearest%20Neighbors.ipynb)
2. [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/yiliang0303/Clustering-of-White-Wine-Quality/blob/main/NaiveBayes.ipynb)
3. [Decision Tree](https://github.com/yiliang0303/Clustering-of-White-Wine-Quality/blob/main/Decision%20Tree.ipynb)
4. [Random Forest](https://github.com/yiliang0303/Clustering-of-White-Wine-Quality/blob/main/Random%20Forest.ipynb)
5. [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/yiliang0303/Clustering-of-White-Wine-Quality/blob/main/Logistics%20Regression.ipynb)
6. [Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/yiliang0303/Clustering-of-White-Wine-Quality/blob/main/Support%20Vector%20Machines%20(SVM).ipynb)
7. [MLP Classifier](https://github.com/yiliang0303/Clustering-of-White-Wine-Quality/blob/main/MLPClassifier%20(NN).ipynb)

Conclusion : Random Forest give the best performance scores.
